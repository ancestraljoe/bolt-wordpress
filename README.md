# Bolt Landing

This repository contains the build output for the Bolt landing page.
The `dist` directory holds the production-ready assets generated by Vite.

## Manual HTML embed

To embed the landing page manually in WordPress, open
[`wp-plugin/embed-snippet.html`](wp-plugin/embed-snippet.html) and copy its
contents into a *Custom HTML* block on a page or post. The snippet references
the CSS and JavaScript files in the plugin folder.

If you upload the files somewhere else, adjust the paths in the snippet so they
point to the correct location on your site.
